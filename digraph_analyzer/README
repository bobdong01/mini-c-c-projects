Structure:
	main file: digraph_analyzer.cpp
	helper functions: digraph_functions.cpp
	header file: digraph_functions.h

functions inside digraph_functions.cpp/.h:
1. std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> get_data(std::ifstream &infile):
   this function extracts all the data from the files and store in a vector of vector of string

2. std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> to_lower(std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> data):
   as the name suggests, this function convert everything in the vector of vector of string to lower case to match the requirement of case-insensitivity

3. std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> map_string(std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> data):
   this function check for digraphs/trgraphs in the text stored in the vector of vector of string and map them according in a map of string and vector of string

4. void print(std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> string_map, std::string command):
   this fuction print everything in the map based on the command; for example, if command is a
   it would print: key: [element1, ..., elementn] in ASCII order

5. bool is_string_number(std::string input):
   as its name suggest, this function check if a string a number


Additional Change:
	   in addtion to functions, I checked in main whether the input is number of digraphs and made sure each case is handled properly with for loops and iterators.
